### 🔵 $INDY: For the People. For the Youth. For the City.

**$INDY is more than a memecoin — it’s a movement.**  
Loud, proud, and built in **Indianapolis**, $INDY is a **community-fueled coin** backing the next generation of **hoopers, dreamers, and diehard fans**.

🏀 **All proceeds** go directly to supporting **youth athletics**, **organized camps**, and **local causes** that uplift our neighborhoods and empower our kids.

This initiative was founded by a community leader from the **award-winning Turtoring Team** at **School on Wheels**, with a vision:  
To bring **kids closer to the action**, create lasting **community impact**, and open doors through **sports, access, and opportunity**.

🚫 It’s time to **kick out the suits** and their business deals from the lower level of Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  
🎟️ Let’s fill those seats with families, fans, and the future of Indy.

### 🏃‍♂️ Run, Don’t Walk.

Get in early. Ride the playoff hype. And be part of something real.  
This is **$INDY** — a **GOLDen token** making waves, changing lives, and bringing basketball back to the people.

📣 **Get involved. Stay involved. Spread the word.**
