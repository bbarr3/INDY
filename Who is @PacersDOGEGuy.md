- Yes, I am real

# Diehard Indy Sports Fan
  - I spend way too much time and money on Indiana Sports. I travel to games, get a hotel, eat out, drinks (uhh 1 or 2), ticket prices ($1M) and gamble with my heart just to watch my team lose. Nobody has it worse than Indiana Sports
  - I am just like you. A normal guy who wants to do cool things for my community. My favorite thing in the world is sports and helping the youth. Why not combine the two?
    - Don't belive me? I am literally a School on Wheels toutor, bro
  - I wanted to use this space to let you know I am not a bot or a fake person who never leaves the basement
